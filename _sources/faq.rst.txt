Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

What is the Binder community?
-----------------------------

A collection of people that aim to make it easy to turn
computational material (e.g. Jupyter notebooks, R scripts, and environment
files) into computational environments (a Docker image) and serve this
environment through the cloud. The underlying technology that manages this
process is called `BinderHub`_.

What is BinderHub?
------------------

`BinderHub`_ is the server technology that
turns computational material into
interactive computational environments in the cloud. It utilizes
`Kubernetes and JupyterHub <https://z2jh.jupyter.org>`_ in order to
simplify the deployment process and make it easy to scale.

What is ``mybinder.org``?
-------------------------

``mybinder.org`` is a single deployment of a BinderHub instance, managed by
the Binder community. It serves as both a public service and a demonstration
of the BinderHub technology, though it is by no means the only BinderHub
in existence. If you're interested in deploying your own BinderHub for your
own uses, please see the `BinderHub documentation <BinderHub_>`_
and don't hesitate to reach out to the `Binder community <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder>`_.

Is ``mybinder.org`` free?
-------------------------

Yes! Though note that it has relatively :ref:`limited computational resources
<user_memory>`.

How can ``mybinder.org`` be free?
---------------------------------

The Binder project has a `grant from the Moore Foundation <https://figshare.com/s/e9d0ad7bdc4e405cccfa>`_
to sustain the cloud resources running ``mybinder.org``. In the future we hope to see more
public BinderHub services running that can form a collection of community
resources for interactive cloud computing.

.. _user_memory:

How much memory am I given when using Binder?
---------------------------------------------

If you or another Binder user clicks on a Binder link, the ``mybinder.org``
deployment will run the linked repository. While running, you are guaranteed
to have at least 1G of RAM. There is an upper-limit of 4GB (if you use more than
4GB your kernel will be restarted).

What is a Binder?
-----------------

A Binder is a GitHub repository that has been outfitted with the appropriate
`build files <http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/samples.html>`_ so
that its content can be connected with a BinderHub instance.

What can I do if ``mybinder.org`` does not meet my needs?
---------------------------------------------------------

``mybinder.org`` uses software called `BinderHub`_ to carry out its services.
This is an Open Source, community-driven project that can be deployed on
most cloud providers. If you desire more computational resources for users or
want guaranteed uptime, consider setting up your own BinderHub deployment.

For more information, see the `BinderHub documentation <BinderHub_>`_
for instructions on how to deploy your own BinderHub, and the
`Zero to JupyterHub <https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-experience.html#set-user-memory-and-cpu-guarantees-limits>`_
documentation for how to customize the user environment.
