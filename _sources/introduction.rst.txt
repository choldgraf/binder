Getting started with Binder
===========================

An interactive introduction to Binder
-------------------------------------

For a quick introduction to Binder, and a demonstration of how you can
make a Binder-ready repository, click the Binder link below:

What can I do with Binder?
--------------------------

Binder makes it simple to generate reproducible computing environments from a
Git repository. Binder uses the BinderHub technology to generate a Docker
image from this repository. The image will have all the components that you
specify along with the Jupyter Notebooks inside. You will be able to share a URL
with users that can immediately begin interacting with this environment via the
cloud. Binder's goal is to enable as many analytic workflows as possible.

For example, Binder currently supports:

* Python, Julia, and R kernels (natively, with other kernels possible via a
  Dockerfile) (links for `python <https://github.com/binder-examples/conda>`_,
  `R <https://github.com/binder-examples/r>`_, and `Julia <https://github.com/binder-examples/julia-python>`_)
* Jupyter Notebooks (`link <https://github.com/binder-examples/python-conda_pip>`_)
* Jupyter Lab (`link <https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo>`_)
* RStudio sessions (`link <https://github.com/binder-examples/r>`_)
* Interactive presentations with RISE (`link <https://github.com/binder-examples/jupyter-rise>`_)

Among many others workflows!

Generating a sharable Binder link
---------------------------------

You may share a link that generates a Binder. To generate a link for your
Binder repository, visit `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_ and type in the information for your repository.
You will see your Binder link automatically generated as you fill in the form.

The link structure is::

   https://mybinder.org/v2/<provider-name>/<org-name>/<repo-name>/<branch|commit|tag>?filepath=<path/to/notebook.ipynb>

Share this link with anyone (i.e. colleagues, students) who would like to use
your Binder.

What technology does Binder use?
--------------------------------

Binder combines several open-source technologies, especially:

* `repo2docker <https://repo2docker.readthedocs.org>`_, for quickly generating
  Docker images from a GitHub repository.
* `JupyterHub <https://z2jh.jupyter.org>`_, for connecting a built Docker
  image to cloud computation and a user-facing web portal.
* `BinderHub <https://binderhub.readthedocs.org>`_, for gluing the above two
  tools together to create the Binder experience.
