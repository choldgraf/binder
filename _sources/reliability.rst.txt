``mybinder.org`` status and reliability
=======================================

This page serves as a source of information for general Binder status
updates, building/launching statistics, and reliability metrics.

Site Reliability Goals
----------------------

``mybinder.org`` is a free service running on open-source software. It should
be treated as "beta" technology. As such, the Binder team chooses reliability
goals that are generally less than the gold-standard in industry. Below are
some general reliability goals we aim for.

* GOAL 1
* GOAL 2

.. note::

   The ``mybinder.org`` team can always use more help in maintaining the
   BinderHub deployment that runs this site. If you're interested in getting
   involved, please reach out to us on `our Gitter channel <https://gitter.im/jupyterhub/binder>`_.
