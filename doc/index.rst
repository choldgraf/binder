**Binder** allows you to create custom computing environments that can be shared
and used by many remote users. It is powered by `BinderHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub>`_,
which is an open-source tool that deploys the Binder service in the cloud.
One-such deployment lives here, at `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_, and is free to use.
For more information about the mybinder.org deployment and the team that runs it, see
:ref:`about`.

This documentation provides information for those who
wish to use a pre-existing BinderHub deployment such as `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_.
If you'd like documentation on how to create and administer your own BinderHub deployment,
see the `BinderHub documentation <http://binderhub.readthedocs.io>`_, which
guides you through deploying your own BinderHub.

See the `Binder Examples <https://github.com/binder-examples>`_ GitHub
organization for sample Binder repositories demonstrating its functionality.

.. note::

   Binder is a research pilot, whose main goal is to understand usage patterns
   and workloads for future evolution and development. It is not a service that
   can be relied on for critical operations.
